Automatically move Gmail messages to Trash after a retention period defined by a Gmail label.

Gmail filters decide **which messages receive a retention policy**. Retention Manager decides **when those messages expire**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> New installations use **Message mode**, which evaluates each directly labeled message independently. **Thread mode** remains available when a user wants the newest message to control the entire conversation. The application moves eligible messages to Trash; it does not permanently delete them.

## Key features

- Retention policies expressed in minutes, hours, days, weeks, calendar months, or calendar years
- Policies applied manually, through Gmail filters, or in bulk
- Managed schedules and manual **Run Now** processing
- Gmail sidebar with status, live scan progress, and complete settings
- Native card pages for rules, schedules, notifications, labels, backups,
  filter cleanup, and diagnostics
- Selectable **Message mode** and **Thread mode** retention behavior
- Automatic handling of multiple retention labels
- Deletion summaries with direct links to conversations in Gmail Trash
- Separate result counts for ordinary messages moved and application notifications cleaned up
- Safe suggestions for combining simple, redundant Gmail filters
- Settings backups and validated configuration
- Optional GitHub release checks
- Recovery for interrupted runs and large deletion reports

## How it works

1. Apply a retention label such as `Retention/7d` to a Gmail message or conversation.
2. A managed Apps Script trigger runs on the selected schedule.
3. Retention Manager uses the selected processing mode:
   - **Message mode** calculates expiration for each directly labeled message.
   - **Thread mode** calculates expiration from the conversation’s newest message.
4. If multiple policies apply, the policy that expires latest wins.
5. Expired active messages are moved to Trash.
6. A deletion summary reports ordinary messages moved; expired Retention Manager notifications are reported separately in the scan result.

The scan schedule determines when expiration is checked. A seven-day policy does not guarantee processing at the exact moment seven days have passed.

## Installation

Retention Manager is currently available as a manual Google Apps Script installation.

The installation requires two files from the same published release:

- `retention-manager.gs`
- `appsscript.json`

Follow the complete [Installation Guide](https://github.com/dynamiccookies/Retention-Manager-for-Gmail/wiki/Installation).

After installation, use the [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/dynamiccookies/Retention-Manager-for-Gmail/wiki/Getting-Started) to configure the schedule, create retention labels, and run the first scan.

## Requirements

- A Gmail account
- Permission to create and authorize a standalone Google Apps Script project
- A desktop browser for the initial installation

A separate Google Cloud project is not required for the manual installation.

## Permissions and privacy

Retention Manager uses Gmail access to read labels and message metadata, apply or remove labels, move eligible messages to Trash, and send summaries to the account that owns the installation. Settings and recovery state are stored in that user's Apps Script User Properties; existing installations migrate automatically from the older script-wide property store.

Gmail filter-management access is used only when the user explicitly operates Filter cleanup.

Gmail information is processed within the user’s Google Apps Script environment. Optional update checks request public release information from GitHub without sending email content or mailbox metadata.

See [Permissions, Privacy, and Security](https://github.com/dynamiccookies/Retention-Manager-for-Gmail/wiki/Permissions-Privacy-and-Security) for details.
